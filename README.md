# E-Commerce Home and About Page Template
- The pages are fully responsive and deliver a fluid user experience.
- The login button calls an overlaying form for authentication.
- The mobile hamburger button is built solely in CSS and transitions into an ‘X’ on-click.
- The product images/links include on-hover overlays that reveal buttons and text.

The pages were originally designed for morekk.com, but they went in a different direction so I had to rebuild (finished product [here](https://morekk.com)). Feel free to clone, but please do not use the logos/flower images.
